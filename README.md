Our main objective is to transfer and store data of any type wirelessly which can be accessed at any point of time and place.

The Security features are : 1.All data are Encrypted.

This app will help to transfer of data from one machine to another efficiently.

# SCREEN SHOTS
We devolped a GUI for client
