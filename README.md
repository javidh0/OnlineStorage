Our main objective is to transfer and store data of any type wirelessly which can be accessed at any point of time and place.  
This is been present in Mac over a generation and No one started an initiative.
We are using SOCKETS in python to make this data transfer more efficient.
The Security features are : 1.All data are Encrypted.
                            2.Only authorized users can access data from the server.
This app will help to transfer of data from one machine to another efficiently.
